# htmlunit-native

The aim of this project is to use the
[GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/)
[NativeImage](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/) support
to generate a native libaray of HtmlUnit that can be used from other eg. C/C++ programs.

This project is in early alpha stage - any contribution is welcome.
